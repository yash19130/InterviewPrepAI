  jd: `About BJAK
The original mission of BJAK is we believe people deserve smarter ways to plan, save and grow their money. This is the origin of our name.

Started in 2019, we built the first mobile-first, insurance platform, enabling insurance to be accessible online by millions in the region. Today, its the leading insurance platform in Southeast Asia.

Today, we are expanding ways to help people in the region — this includes spending, saving, investing, exchanging, travelling, and more. Our mission is help people get more from their money every day.

We have teams working around the world, with over 20 nationalities from our offices and remotely, who truly enjoys their work. We are looking for the most talented and driven people we can find. We are looking for people who work for their passion, not counting hours. Who loves building great next-generation products, not status quo. Who cares about redefining how everyone around us can get the best financial applications, not for an exclusive few.

If you're this person, we'd love to talk to you.

Use analytics, user behaviour and production issues to improve the product.

Strong Android fundamentals and experience shipping production apps.

Good knowledge of Jetpack, Coroutines, Flow and modern Android architecture.

Strong sense of mobile UX, usability, edge cases and user flows.

The Kind of Builder We Want
Thinks in user journeys, not just screens.

Cares about making complex financial products feel simple.

Moves fast without creating messy code.

Notices UX, performance and reliability issues before users complain.

Honest about what they personally built, what was team-owned and what impact they can or cannot claim.

 
This Role Is Not For
Engineers who only want fully defined tickets.

Developers who build screens without caring about user experience.

People who ignore crashes, edge cases, loading states or performance.

Engineers who move slowly in a startup environment.

People who exaggerate impact without explaining their actual contribution.

 
Location
This role is remote, but candidates must be based in India. We are hiring specifically for this market, so applicants should already be based in India.
